# My undergraduate thesis

My first idea for this website was a lot more: exchange value display, making the database of scraping with python (which there isn't in the institution's curriculum, but could have) on money exchange websites (and cryptocoins)

## Aslan: very(fi) good prices

<i>
I am a high school senior coursing integrated computing technician and for the conclusion of the course it is necessary to make a website with everything that we learned in the 3 years of technician, I hope you like it :)

### My idea for Aslan

With the help of my friend and collaborator of this thesis, Lara, my first idea evolved and became Aslan, a verifier of any item that is sold on the web, the first idea of scraping persists and evolves to crop of images, chunks text and any html website item as needed.
