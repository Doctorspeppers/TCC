# My undergraduate thesis

<i>
I am without third year of high school studying an integrated computer technician and for the conclusion of the course it is necessary to make a website with everything that we learned in the 3 years of technician, I hope you like :)

## Aslan: very(fi) prices

My first idea for this website was a lot more, exchange value display, making the date of scraping with python (in the institution's curriculum, but could) on money exchange websites (and cryptocoins)

### My idea for Aslan

With the help of my friend and collaborator of this thesis, Lara, my first idea was to evolve and become Aslan, a tester of any item that is sold on the web, the first idea of scraping persists and evolves to crop of images, chunks text and any html website item as needed.
